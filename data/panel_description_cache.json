Loss of autophagy leads to the accumulation of PKA R1\u03b1- and R1\u03b2-subunits at synapses and impairs PKA signaling by sequestering the catalytic subunit of PKA.

During stress, such as metabolic acidosis, SIRT7 levels increase in the cytoplasm, promoting the interaction and stability of KCC4. This interaction induces an increase in KCC4 protein levels and activity and therefore contributes to the increase of basolateral Cl- efflux, which decreases the intracellular Cl- concentration, thus maintaining the gradient for the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger to eliminate bicarbonate from the cells and increase the secretion of H+ to reestablish acid-base homeostasis.\"\n}\n",

Upon the initial activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), MyD88 aggregates and recruits IRAK4/1, which triggers the activation of TRAF6, subsequently activating the TAK1 and IKK complexes. This leads to the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of I\u03baB. Once NF-\u03baB is released through I\u03baB degradation, it translocates to the nucleus, promoting the translocation of USP3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, USP3 removes the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on MyD88, thereby inhibiting MyD88-dependent NF-\u03baB activation. Although a fraction of USP3 relocalizes to the nucleus after a few hours of stimulation, a considerable amount of USP3 remains in the cytoplasm. Upon secondary TLR stimulation, the detained USP3 in cytoplasm rapidly shuts down NF-\u03baB signaling by directly removing the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on MyD88.

Armi localizes to Yb bodies Piwi-independently, but Piwi localization to Yb bodies depends on Armi. At Yb bodies, Piwi is loaded with piRNA precursor (through their 5\u2032 ends) to become pre-piRISC. Armi joins the complex by binding the downstream region in the precursor and also Piwi. The Armi\u2212Piwi\u2212pre-piRISC complex then leaves Yb bodies to head to mitochondria for Zuc cleavage. The Armi\u2212Piwi\u2212pre-piRISC complex is docked onto mitochondria through the Gasz\u2212Daed complex, under which Zuc cleaves the precursor and releases Piwi\u2212piRISC to the cytosol while Armi returns to Yb bodies for another round of reaction (not shown). Piwi\u2212piRISC is translocated to the nucleus for transposon repression. Nascent Piwi may bind 5\u2032 end of piRNA precursor produced by Zuc cleavage while the RNA is still bound with Armi. Another Zuc cleavage gives rise to phased piRNAs. The Piwi mutant MIDmt does not bind piRNA precursor at Yb bodies, abrogating the whole processing. Another Piwi mutant PAZmt does bind piRNA precursor at Yb bodies, but after Zuc reaction, the 3\u2032 end of piRNA is not bound by the PAZ domain because of the mutation, and so functional piRISC is not sufficiently produced in the cells. The Armi mutant N756A fails to bind piRNA precursor pre-bound with Piwi at Yb bodies, leading to the failure of Piwi\u2212pre-piRISC departure from Yb bodies. Another Armi mutant \u2206N34 is able to bind Piwi\u2212pre-piRISC at Yb bodies but fails to leave the bodies for an unknown reason. The whole processing of Piwi\u2212piRISC formation is well regulated by the interdependence between Armi and Piwi and also the RNA-binding activity of the two proteins.
